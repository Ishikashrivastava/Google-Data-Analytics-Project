Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, you will perform many real-world tasks of a junior
data analyst. You will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and meet different characters and team members. In order to
answer the key business questions, you will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze,
share, and act. Along the way, the Case Study Roadmap tables — including guiding questions and key tasks — will help you
stay on the right path.
By the end of this lesson, you will have a portfolio-ready case study. Download the packet and reference the details of this
case study anytime. Then, when you begin your job hunt, your case study will be a tangible way to demonstrate your
knowledge and skills to potential employers

 IN this case study we will each stage BY ONE BY ONE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT each stages by following steps;
 
 Data Collection: The first step is to gather the relevant data from various sources such as databases, files, APIs, or web scraping. The data may come in different formats, including structured (e.g., CSV, Excel) or unstructured (e.g., text documents, images).

Data Integration: If you have multiple data sources, you may need to integrate them into a single dataset. This process involves merging and combining the data based on common fields or keys to create a unified view.

Data Cleaning: Data often contains errors, missing values, inconsistencies, or outliers that can affect the quality of analysis. During the cleaning process, you identify and handle these issues by applying techniques like data validation, filtering, and imputation.

Data Transformation: Sometimes, the data needs to be transformed or restructured to make it suitable for analysis. This can involve converting data types, normalizing data, or aggregating data at different levels of granularity.

Data Reduction: In cases where the dataset is large and computationally expensive to analyze, data reduction techniques may be applied. These techniques aim to reduce the size of the dataset while preserving its essential characteristics. Examples include sampling, dimensionality reduction, or feature selection.

Data Formatting: To ensure compatibility with the analysis tools or algorithms, the data may need to be formatted into a specific structure or file format. This step involves organizing the data according to the requirements of the chosen analysis techniques.
